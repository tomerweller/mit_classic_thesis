In this thesis I propose solution for crowdsourced problem solving. The first step is an interactive exposition using augmented video with timeline base discussion, and second one is collaborative brainstorming.

In this chapter I will explore the background and related work 

For the first step, I will explore the world of video and try to answer the question of why it is a suitable medium for problem exploration. As background for the augmented video timeline based discussion, 

For the first, I will explore the world of video and try to answer the question of why it is a suitable medium for problem exploration. I will also present a brief history of hypervideo (interactive video) as background for the interactivity aspect of this tool. I will also present different approaches for the crowdsourcing of problem solving along with examples for each of them.

This thesis spans across three major topics: The rise of personal digital fabrication, knowledge driven communities, and Video Hypermedia as an interactive collaboration medium. In this chapter I will offer an overview for each of these topics along with relevant work in the field.

\section{The personal digital fabrication revolution}

<image of the replicator>

The Star Trek Replicator has ignited the imagination of many of my generation. A device that could accurately manufacture, on the spot, clothing items, machine parts and even food and organs (That would require the special genetronic replicator, of course).

We are slowly watching the promise of the Replicator being delivered through modern ls

% Definition. Find a better one
Digital fabrication is the process of manufacturing a physical object according to a digital description of it, with a high level of accuracy. In a more technical jargon it is commonly referred to as Numerically Controlled.

% First CNC (Parson) price, size, picture
A Numerically Controlled milling machine first envisioned in 1942 by John T. Parsons, a machinist and salesman, as a solution for fabricating helicopter propellers. These needed to be extremely accurate in measurements and the manual tools of the time were not up for the challenge.

After several failed attempts at creating it, Parsons eventually approached the Servomechanisms Laboratory at MIT. MIT notoriously cut Parsons out and signed a contract directly with the AirForce to build the machine. 

The machine was finally unveiled in 1952. It took an entire basement in MIT, was extremely complex with 250 vacuum tubes, 175 relays and countless moving parts, and the final bill presented to the air force was of \$360,000.

% more CNCs
Since then, computers have been attached to a plethora of tools: milling machines in different sizes, laths, water jet cutters that utilizes streams of water mixed with abrasive material, laser cutters that cut using powerful lasers and electrical discharge machines that use the heat generated by discharging high voltages through a coil to accurately cut through thick sheets of metal.

% Subtractive 
One thing in common with all of the above methods is that they create objects by subtracting materials. This type of fabrication is called Subtractive Manufacturing. It inherently does not allow for complex inner structures or composite objects to be fabricated at once.

% Additive
The 1980s saw some new fabrication processes that add material rather than subtract it. These ranged from thermally fusing plastic filaments to using UV light to solidify liquid resins (stereo-lithography). These machines quickly became known as 3d printers. 

% Cheap 3d Printer
In recent years, the cost of simple 3d printers have plummeted to a point where basic ones can be bought for less than \$1000. This is much due to open source projects like the RepRap and the expiration of patents, such as the ones on stereo-lithography. This has caused a dramatic increase in the number of 3d printers sold worldwide.

% 3d Printer numbers

% 3d Printers as Microwaves 
3d printers have been receiving a lot of positive press and hailed as a revolution in the making although traditional CNC machines have also seen personal, less expensive versions in recent years including mini milling machines and laser cutters. Neil Greenfeld famously compares 3d printers to the Microwaves of the fabrication world. Once hailed as the ultimate cooking apparatus, in reality is only used for several tasks. In comparison, 3d printers are great for some tasks where other tools don't deliver. Yet, where subtractive manufacturing can be used, it is still has advantages in terms of time and structural properties.

% Maker movement? 

% Makerspaces and Fablabs
The proliferation of digital fabrication tools has also led to the formation of Maker spaces. A Maker space is a physical space that has some digital fabrication equipment in it. These range from basements with a single cheap 3d printer to factory sized hangers with millions of dollars worth of equipment ranging from heavy duty CNC mills to Water jet cutters.  

These makerspaces form a community of inidividuals centered around the interest of digital fabrication.

% Fablabs
One notablae network of Makerspaces is the fablab network. Started by Neil Gershenfeld with a grant from the NFS, it is a network of independently ...

\section{Knowledge in Online Communities}

In his classic 1945 Atlantic article, \"As We May Think\", Vennevar Bush predicts that:

Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex* and there amplified.

(the memex is a hypothetical indexed storage device devised by Bush)

in 1968 after seeing Doug Englabrts work in xxx with xxx, Licklider was foresaw the creation of on-line communities. He predicted that \"They will be communities not of common location, but of common interest. In each field, the overall community of interest will be large enough to support a comprehensive system of field-oriented programs and data\".\cite{licklider1968computer}

Both of these predictions were extremely accurate. But more than that - we have also seen them merge into one: Knowledge based communities. On-line communities that are centered around Knowledge - sharing it, accumulating it and helping other members. 

These communities range greatly in their character. In this section I will explore various Knowledge Based Communities across 4 dimensions: structure, specialization, governance and motivation. 

Structured vs. Unstructured. 

One might claim that the Internet itself is a Knowledge base community. One with no imposed structure at all besides the basic network stack that defines how two peers communicate. Once these peers have connected, the bits flowing between them can represent anything from text to videos to candy crush scores.

Some of these communities, such as Wikipedia, are extremely structured. There are strict guidelines and imposed style. The final value 

Some of these are structured. Some are not. 

Specialized vs. General

Governed vs. Ungoverned

\section{Hypermedia}

In my thesis I propose Hypervideo as a platform for communication and collaboration. In this section I will explore the origins and current state of Video Hypermedia.


% In editing, we extrapolate shareable story from the noise. As cinema frees itself from the constraints of the inherently linear celluloid base, a new meta-cinema explodes the myth of the heroic by projecting itself into our everyday environments. (Gloriana)

% Definition
Hypervideo is a medium that adds graphics, text and hyperlinks to Video. % more

% Origins. Interactive video - Kinoautomat
The origins of Hypermedia can be traced to Interactive Cinema. A non linear cinematic includes decision points in which the viewer or viewers choose one of several possible plot directions.

The first interactive cinema movie is considered to be Kinoautomat(cite), shown in the Montreal World Exp in 1967. At nine points during the film, the screening would stop and a moderator would ask the audience to vote between two possible decisions that represent two possible scenes. The votes were counted and the winning scene would be played next.    

% The transition to Hypervideo - Andy’s Aspen thing
With the introduction of computers and digital media, such experiences became easier to implement. Moreover, they allowed the addition of hyperlinks, images and text layers in addition to the base video layer. Marking the move from Interactive Cinema to Hypermedia.  

The first Hypermedia experience is often credited to be the Aspen Movie Map[cite] created at the MIT Architecture machine shop in 1978. The Aspen movie map was a Virtual tour through the streets of Aspen, Colorado, facilitated by a touch display. A user would sit in front of the display and shown a film from the point of view of a car driving through the streets. A touch user interface allowed the user to \"turn\" the direction of the moving car, or focus on a specific building to get more data about it including text and images. 

<add picture of Andy smoking a pipe>

% First signs of Collaboration - Glorianna and the Elastic Charles
Hypermedia stayed a focus of the Architecture machine group as they transitioned and became the MIT Media Lab. One notable project led by Glorianna Davenport, was \"The Elastic Charles\", a HyperMedia experience that revolved around a time-lapse journey down the Charles river in Boston. Fifteen students contributed to the project by placing hyper links to text, graphics and extra video content on a base film, corresponding to the location portrayed in it. 

% The Web 
With the introduction of the Web, the distribution of HyperVideo using standard technologies became easier. The popular video distribution platform Youtube(link) allows video creators to place simple hyperlinks on a specific time and location in their videos that link to other videos published by them. Platforms such as Interlude(link) make it easy to create and publish nonlinear videos, where users can make plot decisions and control which scenes are displayed next. Popular streaming service Amazon Video (link) have began overlaying TV Shows with hyper links to learn more about the actors relevant to specific scenes being watched. %Pornhub?

Still, we have yet to see an explosion of full blown, HyperVideo experiences on the web.

% The "OLD"
 One thing in common to all of these examples of Hypermedia is that they were all published in the classical sense of publication. That means that once all post production, including the addition interactive layers, was done, the piece was frozen in time, never to be modified.

% One might wonder, in the age of user generated content and social media, what has happened to Hypermedia Video?

% Crowdsourcing problem solving
\section{Crowdsourced problem solving}

With the widespread adoption of the Internet, Crowd sourcing platforms have become extremely popular. These platform enlist the services of any number of people, either paid or unpaid, to perform tasks that contribute to a project.

One such notable platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk. Mechanical Turk defines two types of users: requesters and workers. Requesters can define simple tasks, such as recognizing images in a picture, and allocate money for the completion of them. Workers can perform tasks that match their skillset and compensation requirements.

However, in most of these platforms, tasks don't require any specialized skills. In contrast, platforms like Upwork target domain experts. Upwork mediates between expert professionals and organizations in need of these specific skills. In contrast to traditional freelancing, there's a high degree of transparency in Upwork, where the professionals are constantly reviewed and potential employers have access to these detailed performance reviews. % Catch a fire?

Taking the concept of professional problem solving even further are platforms like InnoCentive (link). Unlike the skill-centered Upwork, InnoCentive is based on challenges. Any Organization can post challenges with a monetary award and any individual or group can propose solution for these challenges. At the end of the challenge period, the chosen solution gets the money award. InnoCentive is famous for having major companies like Boeing and Dupont seek for creative solutions for some of their unique problems on it.     


% In editing, we extrapolate shareable story from the noise. As cinema frees itself from the constraints of the inherently linear celluloid base, a new meta-cinema explodes the myth of the heroic by projecting itself into our everyday environments.


Ever since the invention of Cinema, there have been attempts to create interactive experiences.

%1.  Production versus consumption.  Historically, film and video have been publication systems:  created once, at great expense, with the intention of multiple viewings, either by many people or many times.  Reference Nicholas, somewhere…  Or Walter Bender, electronic publishing.  Glorianna spent half her career making it easier for people to create high quality stories.  You can look for her work or ask Ellen for direction.  Her idea was to make telling a good story with video easier and accessible.  And at the same time to explore new ways to tell stories.
%
%Instead, what happened is that everyone just started doing it.  Perhaps badly, but certainly with less of an emphasis on the pure quality of the rendition and more on the quantity.  Maybe this was prompted by the presence of cameras, maybe YouTube’s simplification of the process was key, maybe the Internet’s ability to handle streaming played critical roles, maybe all of these.  But the end result is that we are past the threshold:  it seems (numbers would help) that more videos are made than are watched.

%Just as with still photos, the problems have moved from taking them to organizing them.  In other words, you issue is to make sense of a world of video.

%2.  Video is now the domain of data as much as the domain of the visual.  The key questions relate to the data associated with it.  This matters to entertainment where they want to know what to cache or what commercials go along with it, to House of Cards that was computationally spawned.   Here is where you have concentrated a lot of work…
%
%3.  For all its presence and good, video is still a bit of a pain in the ass.  Notes like”watch this until the end,”  “Only three minutes but worth every one of them…”   You can catalog these tweets and facebook messages.  It takes time.  Your time. It has demands that other media lack.

%bush1988we
Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual.
There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers—conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial.
Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.


%licklider1968computer
In a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face.

Whether we attempt to communicate across a division of interests, or whether we engage in a cooperative effort, it is clear that we need to be able to model faster and to greater depth. The importance of improving decision- making processes—not only in government, but throughout business and the professions—is so great as to warrant every effort.

On-line interactive communities
But let us be optimistic. What will on-line interactive communities be like? In most fields they will consist of geographically separated members, some- times grouped in small clusters and sometimes working individually. They will be communities not of common location, but of common interest. In each field, the overall community of interest will be large enough to support a comprehensive system of field-oriented programs and data.

What will go on inside? Eventually, every informational transaction of sufficient consequence to warrant the cost. Each secretary’s typewriter, each data-gathering instrument, conceivably each dictation microphone, will feed into the network.


%halevy2009unreasonable
The  first lesson of Web-scale learning is to use available large-scale data rather than hoping for annotated data that isn’t available. For instance, we find that useful semantic relationships can be automatically learned from the statistics of search queries and the corresponding results or from the accumulated evidence of Web-based text patterns and formatted tables, in both cases without needing any manually annotated data.
